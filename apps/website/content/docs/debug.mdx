## Prompt Not Appearing in IDE

**Symptom:**
The stagewise toolbar loads, you type and send a prompt, but nothing arrives in your IDE.

**Probable Cause:**
Your prompt was sent to a different running instance (window) of the IDE.

**Workaround:**

* Close or deactivate any duplicate IDE sessions before sending prompts.

**Next Steps:**

* Tracked under issue [#151](https://github.com/stagewise-io/stagewise/issues/151).
* A permanent fix is in progress and will be released soon.

## Does Not Work in SSH Remote Session on WSL

**Symptom:**
stagewise toolbar fails to initialize or send prompts when connecting via SSH remote session on WSL.

**Resolution:**

* *Currently under investigation.* No official workaround available.

**Next Steps:**

* Tracked under issue [#172](https://github.com/stagewise-io/stagewise/issues/172).
* We are working on compatibility support for SSH‑remote workflows.

## Toolbar Only Works on Localhost

**Symptom:**
The stagewise toolbar fails to load or function properly when accessing your development environment through:
- Local network addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.100:3000`)
- Tunneled environments (e.g., ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel)
- Remote development servers
- Docker containers accessed via non-localhost URLs

**Probable Cause:**
The stagewise toolbar is designed to work exclusively with `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` addresses for security and architectural reasons.

**Workaround:**

* Access your development environment using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` instead of other network addresses
* If using Docker, ensure port mapping allows access via localhost (e.g., `-p 3000:3000`)
* For remote development, consider using SSH tunneling to forward ports to localhost

**Next Steps:**

* This is a current architectural limitation
* Support for hosted development environments may be considered for future releases based on user demand
