If you want to use stagewise with an IDE-provided chat agent or some other CLI application, here's how to do so.

> We don't actively support custom integrations with agents other than the stagewise agent. But: We encourage our community to build custom integrations! [Here's a guide on how to do so](/docs/developer-guides/build-custom-agent-integrations).

## Agents supported through the stagewise code editor extension

The stagewise code editor extension allows you to connect the toolbar to a wide variety of IDE-integrate coding agents.

Please note, that the support of the below mentioned IDEs and IDE Extensions is fairly rudimentary.

| Agent           | Supported      |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Cursor          | ✅             |
| GitHub Copilot  | ✅             |
| Windsurf        | ✅             |
| Cline           | ✅             |
| Roo Code        | ✅             |
| Trae            | ✅             |

IDE chat integrations work like this:

  - You send a message through the toolbar
  - The stagewise code editor extension forwards the message along all necessary information to the best available agent chat window
  - In most cases, you will be required to switch over to the IDE to send the message to the agent.
    - This is due to a limitation in the IDE provided APIs.

## Community-driven agent integrations
