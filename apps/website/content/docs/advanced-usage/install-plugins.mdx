Plugins enhance your experience with stagewise by giving you an easy way to add additional capabilities to your toolbar and more information for the agent.

## How to integrate plugins

Plugins are integrated by adding them to the config entry of your project's stagewise integration.

For component-based frameworks like React, an integration typically looks like this;

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import type { Metadata } from 'next';
import { StagewiseToolbar } from '@stagewise/toolbar-react';
import ExamplePlugin from '@stagewise/plugin-example'; // <-- This is ann imported plugin


export default function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <StagewiseToolbar config={{ plugins: [ExamplePlugin] }} /> // <-- Add them to the toolbar like this
        {/* ... */}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```


## Recommended plugins for your project

We highly recommend adding a framework-dedicated plugin to your project in order to get even better results and a nicer experience.

- We support and distribute support of the following frameworks:
  - React & Next (`@stagewise-plugins/react`)
  - Angular (`@stagewise-plugins/angular`)
  - Vue & Nuxt (`@stagewise-plugins/vue`)
- If your framework is not listed, don't worry! stagewise will work just fine.
  - If you want to add improved support for an additional framework, feel free to create a plugin and tell us about it!


## Community-created plugins

Feel free to build plugins using the guidelines found in our [Plugin Developer Guide](/docs/developer-guides/build-plugins)
and add them to this page by making a contribution to [our project's repository](https://github.com/stagewise-io/stagewise)!
