## Get Started

### 1. Start your web app in development mode

The first thing you should do is to start your app in regular development mode


### 2. Navigate to your app's root directory

**Important**: stagewise must be run from your app's root directory (where your `package.json` file is located) to work properly. 

Open a new terminal window and navigate to your app's directory:

```bash
# Navigate to your app directory
cd /path/to/your/app

# Verify you're in the right place - you should see package.json
ls package.json
```

### 3. Start stagewise

stagewise can be integrated into your workflow without requiring you to install anything!

From your app's root directory, run:

```bash
npx stagewise@latest
```

or (if you're using pnpm):

```bash
pnpm dlx stagewise@latest
```

And simply follow the short guide of the CLI app to setup your stagewise account.
