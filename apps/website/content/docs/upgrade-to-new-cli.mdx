title: Upgrade to the stagewise CLI
description: If you've previously used the stagewise toolbar package and IDE extension, it's time to upgrade. This guide tells you how.
---

## Why you should upgrade

The new stagewise CLI offers significant benefits in ease-of-use, functionality and compatibility with all kinds of web apps:

  - **No need for dependency packages in your web app anymore**
    - No build issues
    - No increased bundle size
    - No licensing worries 
  - **First-class integration of the stagewise agent**
    - Get started faster
    - Frontend changes are a first-class citizen
  - **The toolbar now hosts your app**
    - Keep using the toolbar even when your dev app crashes
    - Completely independent from any framework that your app uses
  - **Instant updates without worrying**
  - **Automatically loads the right plugins for your app**
    - The CLI detects used frameworks and dependencies and loads the best (officially supported) plugins automatically for you


## How to upgrade

Making the switch to the CLI is easy an consist of the following steps:

1. Remove all stagewise toolbar and plugin dependencies from your web app (`package.json`)
2. Uninstall the stagewise extension from your code editor ([unless you want to continue using the agent of your IDE](#continue-using-other-agents))
3. Open a terminal window in the root of your dev app
4. Enter `npx stagewise` (or `pnpm dlx stagewise` if you're using pnpm) to start the stagewise CLI **without even having to install it**.
5. Tell the CLI on which port your dev app is served
6. That's it! A browser window will pop up and you're now using the new stagewise CLI ðŸŽ‰

If you want to change on which port the toolbar is hosted or modify other preferences, take a look at the [CLI deep dive](/docs/advanced-usage/cli-deep-dive).


## If the CLI doesn't work

Although we tested lots of scenarios for our new CLI architecture, there very well may be some issues that pop up in your specific setup.

In these cases, please [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/stagewise-io/stagewise/issues) and [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/DjMqMnUVCh) to help us fix these issues asap!

## Continue using other agents

We recommend using the built-in stagewise agent for your frontend work, but if you want to continue using the agents of your code editor, or some other extension, make sure to:

  - Start the CLI in **Bridge mode** (`npx stagewise -b`)
  - Keep the stagewise extension in your code editor (if you want to use the agent of Cursor, Windsurf, VSCode, etc.)

*While we will gradually phase out the work on our current code editor extension, we're committed to keep this open and highly integratable model of stagewise a top priority for our product.*
