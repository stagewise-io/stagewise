Want to contribute to stagewise or test your changes locally? Follow these steps to get the development environment up and running.

## Quick Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stagewise-io/stagewise && cd stagewise
```

2. Install dependencies and start the development server:
```bash
pnpm i && pnpm dev
```

3. Open the `stagewise` project in your IDE

4. Prepare the extension environment:
   - Uninstall or disable the official `stagewise` extension
   - Press F5 (this will open a new IDE window with the local extension version installed)

5. Visit `http://localhost:3002` to see the example application

## What to Expect

Once set up, you'll see:
- A Next.js example application with the `stagewise` toolbar already configured
- The toolbar will be connected to your local extension in `apps/vscode-extension`
- Any changes you make to the extension code will be reflected in real-time
