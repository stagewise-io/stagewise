                At its core, stagewise is the result of developers that are
                driven by a single goal: to build tools we love to use.

                in Germany, where we connected over a shared ambition to build
                better software. Our story wasn't a straight line to success. We
                first chased an idea that didn't work out at all, but we
                navigated that challenge together. That shared struggle was
                critical, because it led us to the insight that now defines
                stagewise.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we built prototypes for new ideas, we both felt the same
                frustration: the magical, high-speed experience of modern AI app
                building tools vanished once moving into a real-world codebase.
                We knew that there had to be a way to bring this visual
                experience into production-level projects - and we found one!
