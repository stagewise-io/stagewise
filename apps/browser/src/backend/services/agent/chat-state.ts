// This class manages the state of the chat interface.
// It is new so it only takes over a part of what is needed within the chat, but it can be expanded over time.
// For now, it's only relevant to manage things like selected elements, relevant codebase files, etc.
// (Because these things need to be handled across main/renderer anyway, so we put them here.)
