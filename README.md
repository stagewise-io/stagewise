## 🎬 About the Project

🎥 *\[Video showing the toolbar with a comment on an element and how the changes are applied after re-render]*

### Eyesight for your AI-powered code editor

An open-source solution to provide AI code editors like Cursor or GitHub Copilot with actual data from the browser. Just comment on an element and your code editor receives the DOM element, your comment, and supporting data as prompt context. No more pasting code, linking folders, or navigating deep trees.
